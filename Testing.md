# Testing Strategy Overview

This document outlines our comprehensive testing strategy, covering different types of tests used in our DevOps lifecycle. It provides context, tools, and practices for each test type, ensuring our applications are reliable, secure, and maintainable throughout development and deployment.

## Why Testing Matters

Testing ensures that code behaves as expected, integrations work seamlessly, automation scripts function correctly, and our deployments are stable and secure. It is integrated early and continuously within our CI/CD pipeline to detect issues as soon as possible, thereby reducing production risks.

## Types of Testing

### 1. Unit Testing
**Purpose:** Validate individual functions or modules in isolation.

**Explanation:** Unit tests are the foundation of quality assurance. Developers write these tests to verify the logic of specific functions or methods before integration. Fast to run, they provide immediate feedback.

**Tools:** Pytest, unittest (Python), xUnit (.NET)

**When:** On every commit or pull request

---

### 2. PowerShell Testing
**Purpose:** Ensure PowerShell scripts used in automation work correctly.

**Explanation:** PowerShell is heavily used in our pipelines for deployment and infrastructure tasks. We use Pester to validate individual scripts, functions, and parameter logic to avoid failures in CI/CD execution.

**Tools:** Pester

**When:** As part of CI pipeline or dedicated script validation stage

---

### 3. Integration Testing
**Purpose:** Validate communication between system components.

**Explanation:** These tests ensure that APIs, services, databases, and other modules interact properly. They catch issues that unit tests cannot, like serialization errors or database misconfigurations.

**Tools:** Postman + Newman, Python requests + Pytest, PowerShell

**When:** After application build or in dedicated test environments

---

### 4. Database Testing
**Purpose:** Ensure data integrity and safe migrations.

**Explanation:** Database changes are tested through schema validation, stored procedures testing, and mock data validation. This protects against breaking data structures or corrupting production data.

**Tools:** pgTAP, psql, Liquibase, PowerShell scripts

**When:** Post-deployment or during staging phase

---

### 5. Pipeline & YAML Testing
**Purpose:** Ensure ADO pipeline YAMLs and templates work reliably.

**Explanation:** We use linters and dry-run validation for YAML files that define our Azure DevOps pipelines. This prevents misconfigurations and deployment failures due to syntax or logic errors.

**Tools:** Azure DevOps Pipeline Linter, Yamllint, Pester (for pipeline logic)

**When:** During pipeline authoring and in CI

---

### 6. Shell Script Testing
**Purpose:** Validate bash scripts used in automation and Docker builds.

**Explanation:** Shell scripts play a critical role in automation and containerization. We use static analysis and test frameworks to catch syntax errors, bad practices, and edge cases.

**Tools:** ShellCheck, Bats, custom Bash test scripts

**When:** In CI or pre-container builds

---

### 7. Static Code Analysis
**Purpose:** Detect code quality issues early.

**Explanation:** Static analysis checks code for bugs, security vulnerabilities, and style violations before execution. It supports maintainability and enforces consistent coding standards across teams.

**Tools:** SonarCloud, Pylint, ESLint, Flake8

**When:** Every CI run

---

### 8. Security & Dependency Scanning
**Purpose:** Identify vulnerabilities and compliance issues.

**Explanation:** We scan all source code, libraries, and container images to detect known vulnerabilities and license issues. This ensures our software is secure and compliant.

**Tools:** Trivy, Grype, OWASP Dependency-Check, Syft (SBOM)

**When:** On every build and before production release

---

### 9. End-to-End (E2E) Testing
**Purpose:** Simulate real user behavior and workflows.

**Explanation:** E2E tests run across the full stack, mimicking actual user scenarios to ensure that the application behaves correctly from start to finish. They are crucial for validating business-critical flows.

**Tools:** Playwright, Selenium, Postman Collections

**When:** In QA/Staging environments post-deployment

---

### 10. Performance Testing
**Purpose:** Validate system behavior under load.

**Explanation:** These tests evaluate how the system performs with expected or high traffic. They help identify bottlenecks and ensure the app can scale appropriately.

**Tools:** k6, Apache JMeter

**When:** Pre-release, after infra or app changes
